# TODO

I am going to finish the method section and style up my thesis by going through
syntax from saga's paper.
Then I am going to check out pitch-machine.com and how I can update my url domain pointex.

Then Brush up facebook by creating a group with Saga's poster as background.

Lastly update text inside of the app, which shouldn't take too long. I just have to checkout
a new branch and then bombard the project with small text improvements. This is going to be
quite fun actually. Because I get to play around with git also which is always nice.

Then I have to conctact Andre and describe my situation and see what we can do.

Which is also goint to be very nice.

> > > Now I am going to go to heroku's website and prepare for changing the URL.

this shouldn't be so difficult I think because somehow I have this domain and
so I should be able to point my website to this domain. Otherwise what's the
point of doing this??
