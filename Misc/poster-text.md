- intro
  `Have you ever used an app for musical ear training? Are you interested in picking up an instrument or learning music? Then this might be something for you!`
- who am i?
  `My name is Hjalmar and I study 'media technology and sound' at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. I am writing my master's thesis and I want to invite you to participate in a scientific study that I am conducting by using an app that I have built.`
- Vad är detta?
  `The aim of the thesis is to investigate two methods for training ones ears to be able to recognize and point out musical intervals. In music there are 12 intervals (major 3rd, minor 3rd, and 10 more) that one needs to internalize in order to be able to hear and play any melody in western music. Together these 12 intervals make up what is called the 'chromatic scale'.`
- För vem?
  `If you are interested in learning all the intervals of the chromatic scale then this is for you.`
- Varför?
  `In the beginning it is rather tricky to learn all the 12 intervals by heart and one needs to have patience but when one has learnt them the reward is huge because you will be able to hear and know how most music that you listen to is made. In the thesis, as mentionned above, you will be introduced to two methods for practicing intervals. The goal of the thesis is to compare these two methods and analyze if one is better than the other.`
- När? Var? Hur?
  `You participate by using an app called Pitch Machine, which you can find at www.pitch-machine.com. Pitch Machine is a web app - this means that you go to www.pitch-machine.com on your smartphone and 'add' the website to your homescreen. If you are unfamiliar to how one adds a website to homescreen I recommend you search for 'add website homescreen iOS/android'.`
- contact facebook group >> if users has any questions
  `I have also created a facebook group for support should anyone have questions about how to use the app. Don't hesitate to reach out with your questions.`
- share
  `Please share this poster if you know someone that might be interested in participating.`
- results
  `The results of the study will be published in the accompanying facebook group after thesis is finished and all data has been analyzed.`
